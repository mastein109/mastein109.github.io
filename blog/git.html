      Git is very helpful when it comes to tracking changes. Git uses the command commit, which bundles the changes you have made and allows you to add a message to see a quick explanation on what you have done/changed. Git also saves revision history, so you are able to easily see a log of the changes that you have made within the particular project. Changes that are tracked can range from typos, bug fixes, or even adding a whole new page to your project. Finally, tracking changes helps you understand the evolution of your project.

        Git is important for developers when working individually, but is not exactly beneficial for a group of developers. That is where GitHub comes in. The difference between Git and GitHub is simply the difference of local and remote storage. GitHub acts as a remote branch for developers to store his or her work, so that it can be accessed remotely, anywhere and by anyone. GitHub creates a copy of your original file and is an open source environment for other developers to edit, revise, and add to your work.
