##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned that these attributes of the box model are very important. When it comes to positioning and layout, it is very important to have all of your margins set up properly, so that the page content will display the way you want it to. 

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?
I learned that in order to get all of the page's elements positioned correctly, you must pay attention to where certain objects need to be positioned and if they need to have a float attribute. When it comes to positioning, all objects work together with one another, in order to create a consistent flow among the page.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest aspect of design for me to implement was the header section of my blog that remains consistent throughout. The most difficult was when I was arranging my blog post layout. I had to play with the margins a bit to make sure each piece of my body was displayed in order.

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that even the simplest design elements require a lot of planning and designing. In addition, it is important to play around and double check everything, so that you don't wind up with a site disaster!
