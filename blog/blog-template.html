      How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
        To my surprise, it worked out quite nicely. My pair and I were able to discuss what we wanted our wireframe to generally include and then put it into action. We determined who was stronger in designing and worked on a shared screen for the wireframe. Next, we switched roles, and the opposite person wrote the HTML code for our wireframe. While, one was driving, the other navigated by reading instructions and contributing input.

      Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
        Wireframing was definitely a huge help in the development process, especially in our case. Since we weren't sitting next to each other in person, it would be quite difficult, if not impossible to relay what we wanted to display through code. Wireframing before breaking down our blog post into code was an essential part of development.

      What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
        We started out with basic attributes for our blog page and then each input ideas of what else should be included. For example, we came up with links to connect through social media, including a user input box to follow our blog and receive regular updates, as well as an aesthetically plesing image and site title to be displayed throughout.

      What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
        Some new sematic elements I learned about were the article tag and the nav tag. Both were very impotant when creating our blog post code. We utilized the nav tag to present a menu of links to all the pages included on our site.
