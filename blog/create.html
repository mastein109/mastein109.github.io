            <h3>Creating my own Website <br><small><i>February 8, 2016</i></small></h3>
            <p>
              During the nine weeks of Phase-0, I have created and developed my own personal website. It has been both an exciting and frustrating experience! At first, when I created my wireframe I had this beautiful website in mind with all of the bells and whistles. However, as a beginner developer, creating an ideal site is not exactly realistic. There are many steps that go into creating a site from scratch for even the most basic site.
            </p>
            <h4>Wireframing</h4>
            <p>First, let's talk about the planning stage in the very beginning. It is extremely important to create a wireframe for your site, in order to layout in front of you what is going on in your head. Visually seeing the layout helps to understand what may be attainable and what may be a bit too advanced to attain. A wireframe can be as simple as a sketch of your site or as in depth as a layout grid with many attributes. Although it may not seem to be the case, simpler is better! Simplistic design leads to consistency, which is the key to a beautiful website.</p>
            <h4>Main Page</h4>
            <p>Next, you can begin the transformation of your wireframe into code. This can be difficult, but as I mentioned earlier the importance of the wireframe will make this step a bit simpler. Breaking down each part of your wireframe into small steps and sections will guide you through the order of your code. The first file you will be creating is your index file. This will be the main page of your site and will determine the general layout.</p>
            <h4>Additional Pages</h4>
            <p>Once you have your main page up and running, you can move on to create the pages linked to your main page. In my case, I created an about me page, contact information, a portfolio of work, and of course, my blog posts. You should wireframe an index for each additional category when necessary. For instance, I created a blog index to display a list of links to all of my posts. Further, I created a blog template that could be used for each post to maintain consistency.</p>
            <h4>Style</h4>
            <p>Now that you have your templates and index pages set up and running properly, it is time to add some style. This is a lot of fun and allows you to show your individual creativity. However, it is important to not get too carried away and start simple. Along the way, you can add and update your style.</p>
            <h4>Final Thoughts</h4>
            <p>The most difficult part about creating my own site was accepting simplicity. At first, I wanted to add all different attributes to my page, but realized it would not remain consistent if I had done so. Creating a website takes a lot of time and planning. You should never just jump right in and you should always test each change as you go. This will prevent falling down a rabbit hole of complexity and confusion. In addition, maitenance should be implemented at least weekly. Keeping up with your site and making sure all of your links work, is very important. Overall, the experience can be frustrating, but in the end extremely rewarding! After all, you will have a beautiful website to reflect yourself.</p>
