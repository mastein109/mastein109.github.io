      <p class="heading">What is Rails?</p>
      <i>February 1, 2016</i>
        <p>From my previous blog posts, you have a general idea of what Ruby is and looks like from simple Ruby snippets. But, what about Ruby on Rails? Is it related to Ruby? Or is it just another JavaScript/Java mix up? Well, let's discuss them separately and then bring both together.</p>
        <p>Ruby is one of many different programming languages. Ruby is very powerful when viewed as a general-purpose programming language. However, when compared side by side Rails, it is not ranked as highly.
        </p>
        <p>I like to think of Rails as an improvement or add-on to Ruby. Technicall speaking, it is a software library that enhances and extends the Ruby programming language. For example, when you purchase a car, you can choose to go with the standard model or add on and enhance that model. Some choices include media packages, gps software, and many other capabilities. Rails can be thought of as those additional packages. Rails is a package library, or collection of software tools, installed using the command-line interface.</p>
        <p>Rails takes the powerful programming language, Ruby, and combines it with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, in order to create a web application. This composition of languages, Rails, is considered a server-side web framework. Wheras Ruby alone is jsut a backend language that helps build Rails.</p>
