      <p class="heading">Getting to know me...</p>
        <h4>Born & raised:</h4>
        <p>Long Island, New York</p>
        <h4>Interests & Hobbies</h4>
        <p>I am a very active person and ironically love to cook and bake. My main interests include traveling, running, cooking, baking, hiking and yoga. I adopted a black lab/pit mix a year and a half ago. Charlie is the love of my life and I often question who rescued whom. She is most likely always by my side, whether it be relaxing or taking long walks outside.
        </p>
        <h4>Educational Experiences</h4>
        <p>I graduated Fordham University, Gabelli School of Business in May 2015 with a bachelor's degree in Accounting Information Systems. While at Fordham, I had the opportunity to study in London, England during the Fall of 2013. In that time I was able to explore the culture and business of the UK. In my free time, I took advantage of traveling to many different countries and cities throughout Europe.
        </p>
        <h4>Fun Facts</h4>
        <p>One of the quirkiest things about me is my disgust towards purple. There is no rhyme or reason to it, but I do not own, wear, and try to avoid touching anything purple.</p>
